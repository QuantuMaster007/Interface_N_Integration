# ICD Overview

## Purpose
Define **what connects to what**, in what format, at what timing, with what power/safety constraints.

## Scope
- Electrical interfaces (power, wiring, IO)
- Logical interfaces (protocols, messages, state machines)
- Safety interfaces (interlocks, e-stops, alarms)
- Facilities interfaces (utility signals, building systems, network)

## Key artifacts
- IO map (CSV): `data/.../io_map.csv`
- Signal spec (per interface): `docs/interfaces/SIGNAL_SPEC_TEMPLATE.md`
- Network/protocol notes: `docs/interfaces/PROTOCOLS.md`

## Ownership
- Hardware owner:
- Controls owner:
- Facilities owner:
